#This code and data was used to fit models to analyse the spatial movements of dingoes over different seasons, dependent on their sex, status, and sibling survival. 

All analyses were conducted in R, numbered scripts (reflecting the order to run scripts in) are contained in the 'r_scripts' folder. These scripts format the raw data and fit models, as well as plotting model results.

The 'raw-data' folder contains all data required to run models.
